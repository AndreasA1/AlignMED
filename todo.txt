To-Do list (non-ordered):

Foundational:
4) setup zeromq server communication between controller and dash - design cmd string structure
5) make generalized control functions - in progress, need testing

Necessary:
2) write turn-on sequence - in progress
    a) connect to MCP7 first (drive its reset high with rpi gpio)
    b) drive reset pins (low then(?)) high
    c) connect to each i2c chip
    d) connect to each pressure sensor
    - normalize pressures once started (assume they're all at atmosphere)
    - try-excepts for i2c initializations
3) setup interactive graph
6) write automatic control script

Ornamental:
9) make everything pretty

Latter-stage:
7) overthrow the government
8) get fucked up
