To-Do list (non-ordered):

Foundational:
4) setup zeromq server communication between controller and dash
    - setup sub in control class - written
    - add pub in dash, put in callbacks
    - need to make sure they can talk to each other
5) make generalized control functions - in progress, need testing
    -mcp setup - verified
    -tca setup - verified
    -mpr setup - verified
    -open/close valve command - need to write
    -get sensor values function - need to test

Necessary:
2) write turn-on sequence - in progress
    a) connect to MCP7 first (drive its reset high with rpi gpio)
    b) drive reset pins (low then(?)) high
    c) connect to each i2c chip
    d) connect to each pressure sensor
    - normalize pressures once started (assume they're all at atmosphere)
    - try-excepts for i2c initializations
6) write automatic control script
7) write "fill all cells" button and corresponding control function - doing
8) have control class only append to file at the start and then set up a button that clears inherited data from log file -mostly done
9) account for value type errors when an i2c device isnt detected



Ornamental:
9) make everything pretty

Latter-stage:
10) write script to reset chips if there is problem
11) add try-excepts to all component calls
7) overthrow the government
8) get fucked up

Done:
3) setup interactive graph - done
9) fix time series graph, add hovering - done
